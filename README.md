My desgin of a 2 layer PCB to drive a FLip-Dot Matrix (see picture #1) based on an ESP32 Devboad
Includes funcions such as Showing RT by GPS module/Internet Time, Sleep function based on a Photodiode current, CO2 sensing with SDC30, etc...
All the files are ready for production, for schematic/PCB referrence ive included Altium files

Thank you very much for looking up my design ;)
Hope it will help you
